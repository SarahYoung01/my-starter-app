# My Starter App - React App for fun and learning
This app has been started as a way to practice writing a React App along with other technologies/modules.  I had to step away from working on a React app at work and was afraid that I was losing my knowledge of React, ES6/7, etc.

I had the opportunity to share working on this with two of my colleagues:  [Corey](https://github.com/coreyshaw) and [Brian](https://github.com/bd21maxw).

Note, this app was built using node version 8.9

The initial goals were simple:
* **Assignment 1**: Create a page that says "Hello World"
* **Assignment 2**: Create a page that says "Hello, ${your name}" with a text box to enter it in 
* **Assignment 3**: Create a page that says "Hello, ${your name}" like before. include a second page under `/profile` that includes a favorite animal, favorite quote


### Technologies/Modules used
* react
* create-react-app
* react-router
* redux
* redux-thunk
* sass
* webpack (most of it done for us by create-react-app)

### Technologies yet to be used
* Isomorphic
* Redux Middleware
* Enzyme
* Need to build out unit tests in general!!!

## To Run the Thing
